**Improvements need to be done:** 

**pilot page:**

  - grammatical errors reduce professionalism

**draw**：
  - make icons large  
  - show weather update
  - be able to toggle full-screen mode and access the full canvas
  - be able to specify measurements, but prefer to just take a picture or hold up their camera on the tablet 
  - notify the system of typical shady and sunny areas 
  - receive notifications of any plant requirements (popup?) 
  - When they hover over the plant, a summary of the plant’s requirements i.e. whether this is a suitable position should appear.
  - suggest suitable position for optimal sunlight when select plants

**database:**
  - show plants' requirements (what is required to plan this plant)


**calendar:**
  - automatic reminders 
  - manually add reminders
  - if it's raining, show an icon on calendar
